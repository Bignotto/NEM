# NEM
NodeJS + Express + Mongo. Basic API scaffold.

This is a learning project.
The main objective is to build an start point for future APIs with user control and login ready to go. I'm following this series of videos from RocketSeat on YouTube: https://youtu.be/BN_8bCfVp88

The code works like the videos and I am working on minor improvements on the code for better reading.

On the video it is used a local MongoDB server. I used MongoDB cloud, called MongoDB Atlas. It won't be any difference. The only thing that changes is the server connection string.
